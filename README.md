# Sudoku-Java-Project

This Project was assigned to a two-person team for a CS undergrad class about OOP programming. The project was written in Java. The objective of the project was to implement a Sudoku game with a GUI. We needed to use OOP practices, write tests for our code, and comment our code thoroughly to be able to be used with  Javadoc.
